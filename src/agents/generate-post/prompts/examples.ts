  `🔥 Fire door inspections: what to look for

During our inspections across London, we consistently find the same issues:

1) Damaged or missing intumescent strips
2) Gaps exceeding BS 8214 tolerances
3) Missing or defective self-closing devices
4) Incorrect or insufficient hinges
5) Non-fire-rated glazing

A fire door is only as good as its components. Regular inspections by FIRAS-certified contractors are essential.

  `Building Safety Act update

The Building Safety Regulator has now issued guidance on higher-risk building registration deadlines.

What you need to know:

- Regular fire risk assessments required

Compliance isn't optional - it's the law.

  `Why compartmentation matters

Compartmentation is the silent hero of fire safety. It contains fire spread, gives occupants time to evacuate, and protects escape routes.

But it only works if maintained properly. Common failures we see:

- Unsealed service penetrations
- Damaged fire stopping around pipes and cables
- Missing cavity barriers
- Compromised fire doors

Don't wait for an incident. Get a compartmentation survey.

  `🚪 Fire door awareness

Did you know a fire door should hold back fire and smoke for 30 to 60 minutes?

But only if:
- Intumescent strips are intact (not painted over)
- Gaps don't exceed 3mm at head and sides
- Self-closer works properly
- All three hinges are fire-rated
- Vision panels use fire-rated glass

One compromised fire door can put an entire building at risk.

- Third-party audited quality assurance
- Traceability of products and installations
- Compliance with relevant standards
- Professional competence verified

Your building's safety depends on getting it right.

  `Penetration seals explained

Every time a pipe, cable, or duct passes through a fire-rated wall or floor, it creates a potential weak point.

Proper penetration seals:
- Restore the fire resistance rating
- Must be third-party tested
- Require competent installation
- Need regular inspection

Unsealed penetrations are one of the most common fire stopping defects we find.
